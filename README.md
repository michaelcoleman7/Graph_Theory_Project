Problem statement: 
To write a program in python which builds non-deterministic finite automatons (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to determine if the regular expression matches any given string of text.

Projects parts: 
1. Parse the regular expression from infix to postfix notation.
2. Build a series of small NFA’s for parts of the regular expression.
3. Use the smaller NFA’s to create the overall NFA.
4. Implement the matching algorithm using the NFA.
